# IELTSWritingPrediction

## 1.0 Problem Statement
  - Is it possible to predict IELTS writing score only using its essay?

## 2.0 Dataset
The data is collected from Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mazlumi/ielts-writing-scored-essays-dataset)
## 3.0 Challenge
With a small dataset (~1400 data points), it is hard to create a model that generalizes well on unseen data. There are several categories from the dataset: ranging mostly from 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5,..., 9.0.
